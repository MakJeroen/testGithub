<ac:layout><ac:layout-section ac:type="single"><ac:layout-cell><p>The simple branching&nbsp;flow is a branching model that is similar to the classic 'trunk based development' workflow but leverages most of the benefits of git while remaining very simple. It focuses on three basic principles.</p><h2>Master is Deployable</h2><p>Similar to how git-flow works with develop, the master branch works like a stable branch. This branch <strong>can always be deployed</strong> and should always function as expected. People who want the very latest versions of the software can run on this branch. This is also where nightlies can be built. The way this branch is kept in check is by finished (isolated) feature completely before merging it. This means it will go through planning, implementation, automated testing, user testing and acceptance before it is merged.</p><h2>Create Pull Requests Early</h2><p>Pull requests are a central place of communication about an issue. By creating them early you will have a place where an issue can be discussed and the development can be tracked. This means declining a pull request only really happens when it is decided that the proposed solution is incorrect or the issue will be dropped. In other words:&nbsp;<strong>Declined pull request means stop working on this issue</strong>.</p><h2>Never Close Release Branches</h2><p>Releases are permanent. This means <strong>release branches should be permanent too</strong>. Once a release branch is created, this branch can be used to create new minor releases by cherry picking features and fixes from master.</p><p><br /></p></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section><ac:layout-section ac:type="three_equal"><ac:layout-cell><h2>Development Workflow</h2><p><ac:image><ri:attachment ri:filename="development_workflow-draw.io.png" /></ac:image></p></ac:layout-cell><ac:layout-cell><h2>Major Release Workflow</h2><p><ac:image><ri:attachment ri:filename="major_release_workflow-draw.io.png" /></ac:image></p></ac:layout-cell><ac:layout-cell><h2>Minor Release Workflow</h2><p><ac:image><ri:attachment ri:filename="minor_release_workflow-draw.io.png" /></ac:image></p></ac:layout-cell></ac:layout-section></ac:layout>
